Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data (properties) and code (methods).
In OOP, programs are designed by creating objects that interact with each other to solve problems.
Key principles of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

In javascript: OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. In JavaScript, OOP is a way to structure code using "objects" that have properties (data) and methods (functions).
It helps organize and reuse code by modeling real-world entities as objects.

Object-oriented and object-based are related but distinct programming paradigms:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Supports all OOP principles: Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Examples: Java, C++, Python, C#.
You can create classes and objects.
Inheritance is supported: You can create new classes based on existing ones.
Object-Based Programming
Supports objects and encapsulation only.
Does NOT support inheritance or polymorphism.
Examples: JavaScript (pre-ES6), VBScript.
You can create and use objects, but cannot create subclasses.

Summary Table
Feature	Object-Oriented	Object-Based
Objects	        Yes     Yes
Encapsulation	Yes 	Yes
Inheritance	    Yes 	No
Polymorphism	Yes 	No
Examples	   Java,C#	JavaScript

Gotcha:
Just because a language uses objects doesn't mean it's fully object-oriented.
Inheritance and polymorphism are key features that distinguish OOP from object-based programming.

Working with JavaScript Objects:

// Creating an object using object literal
const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    }
};

// Accessing properties and methods
console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice

// Adding new properties
person.city = "New York";

// Deleting properties
delete person.age;

// Iterating over properties
for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}

# Understanding Objects and Object-Oriented Concepts

This note summarizes a discussion about objects, object-oriented programming, object-based programming, and how objects are handled in JavaScript.

## What is an Object?

An object is a fundamental concept often described in several ways:

*   **Real World Entity:** This was a key description given. We discussed why we call it a "real world" entity, not non-real world.
*   **Instead of a Class:** An object can exist independently, not just as an instance of a class (especially relevant in languages like JavaScript).
*   **Key-Value Pair:** Objects store data as collections of properties, which are essentially key-value pairs.

The most important aspect highlighted is that an object is a **Real World Entity**.

### Why "Real World Entity"?

Consider developing a banking application. A complex problem like "banking services" can be broken down into smaller, manageable components (objects) based on real-world concepts:

*   Accounts
*   Transactions
*   Loans
*   Insurance
*   Customers
*   Employees

These elements exist in the real world, and when we model them in software, they become objects. Breaking down a complex real-world problem into smaller, related sub-problems (objects) simplifies the development and understanding of the system. This aligns with the evolution of technology driven by the need to solve increasingly complex problems more efficiently (like manual computation evolving to calculators, then computers, then laptops for portability and higher computation needs).

### Describing an Object: Attributes and Behavior

Objects have characteristics that describe them:

*   **Attributes (Properties):** These are the descriptive features. Using a laptop as an example, its attributes would include:
    *   RAM (e.g., 8GB)
    *   Processor
    *   Graphics Card
    *   Design
    *   Material
    *   Weight
    *   Color

    We describe objects using these attributes.

*   **Behavior:** This refers to what an object *does* or its purpose. The primary behavior of a laptop is computation. While it has additional functions (like playing music or videos), its core purpose is computation. Similarly, the behavior of a pen is writing.

### Other Characteristics of an Object

Beyond attributes and behavior, objects also possess:

*   **Identity:** Each object is unique, even if two objects have the same attributes (e.g., two laptops of the exact same model and specs are still distinct entities).
*   **State:** An object's state represents its current condition, determined by its attributes. An object's state can change when an action (behavior) is performed on it (e.g., the ink level in a pen changes as you write, altering its state). Performing an operation on an object takes it from one state to another.

Therefore, an object can be defined as a real-world entity with attributes (properties), behavior, identity, and state.

## Object-Oriented vs. Procedure-Oriented Programming

Programming languages can be categorized based on how they approach problem-solving.

*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** A language is object-oriented if it is "oriented towards objects," meaning it is designed to work extensively with objects and fully support object principles (attributes, behavior, etc.). If a language "follows what the object wants" and utilizes its properties, it's O-O.

*   **Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP):** These languages focus on processes, procedures, or sequences of instructions rather than primarily on objects.

### Key Difference: Focus

The core difference lies in the focus:

*   **OOP Focus:** Data (Objects)
*   **POP Focus:** Processes / Functions

### Examples of the Difference

*   **E-commerce Search:** When searching for a laptop online, you use filters (like RAM, processor type, price range). You are focusing on providing *data* (the desired property values) to refine the search *before* the process of searching and displaying results occurs. This is an O-O approach – data-centric problem-solving.
*   **Making Tea:** If asked to make tea for a specific number of people (e.g., 2 cups), your first step is to count the people or cups (focus on the *data*). You then use this data to determine the amount of water and ingredients needed *before* starting the process of making tea. This is more O-O; you prioritize the input data. While the process always exists, the emphasis is on the data guiding the process.
*   **Data Structures (C vs. O-O):** In C, a `struct` allows grouping data, similar to object attributes. However, structures in C do not typically integrate functions (behavior) within the structure definition itself. In O-O languages like Java or Python, a `class` (from which objects are created) bundles both data (fields/attributes) and methods (behavior) together. This integration of data and behavior is a key aspect of OOP that structures in C lack, meaning C is generally considered procedure-oriented.

## Object-Oriented vs. Object-Based Programming

There is a distinction between Object-Oriented and Object-Based languages.

*   **Object-Based Programming:** These languages recognize and utilize the concept of objects but do *not* fully implement all key principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
*   **Object-Oriented Programming:** These languages fully support and embrace core O-O concepts.

### Key Differences

The main differences lie in the level of support for advanced O-O features:

*   **Support for Core O-O Features:**
    *   **OOP:** Fully supports Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction.
    *   **Object-Based:** May support some object features (like encapsulation via properties and methods) but often *lack* full support for Inheritance and Polymorphism.
*   **Complexity:** Object-Based languages can sometimes be perceived as simpler due to the absence of complex O-O mechanisms like inheritance trees.
*   **Suitability:** The choice depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If inheritance or polymorphism is crucial, an O-O language is necessary. If a simpler object model suffices, Object-Based might be adequate. Lack of full O-O support can be seen as a disadvantage if those features are needed, or an advantage if simplicity is prioritized.

### Examples

*   **Object-Oriented:** Java, C++, Python
*   **Object-Based:** JavaScript, VBScript

JavaScript, for instance, uses objects and supports encapsulation and some forms of polymorphism, but its prototypal inheritance model is different from classical inheritance in languages like Java/C++, and it doesn't support all typical O-O features in the same way.

## Objects in JavaScript

JavaScript is designed as an **Object-Based** language.

*   **Definition:** A JavaScript object is a collection of properties. A property is a link between a name (key) and a value. The value can be any data type, or it can be a function (in which case the property is called a method).
*   **Real-life Comparison:** Like real-life objects (e.g., a cup with properties like color, weight, material, design), JavaScript objects group related data and functionality.

Since JavaScript is Object-Based (acknowledging objects), we can create and work with objects, giving them properties and defining their behavior (methods).

### Ways to Create and Access Objects in JavaScript

Here are some common ways to create objects in JavaScript:

1.  **Using Object Initializer (`{}`):** This is a simple way to create an object and define its properties and methods directly.
    ```javascript
    let person = {
        name: "Dev",
        age: 30,
        address: "Some Address",
        phoneNumber: "123-456-7890"
    };
    ```
    Accessing properties: Use dot notation.
    ```javascript
    console.log(person.name); // Output: Dev
    ```

2.  **Creating an Empty Object and Adding Properties Later:** You can create an empty object and add properties dynamically using dot notation or bracket notation.
    ```javascript
    let person = {}; // Create an empty object
    person.name = "Dev";
    person.age = 30;
    person['address'] = "Some Address"; // Using bracket notation
    ```

3.  **Nested Objects (Object of Objects):** Objects can contain other objects as the values of their properties.
    ```javascript
    let myHonda = {
        make: "Honda",
        model: "Accord",
        engine: { // 'engine' is a property whose value is another object
            cylinders: 4,
            horsepower: 192
        }
    };
    ```
    Accessing properties within nested objects: Use chained dot notation.
    ```javascript
    console.log(myHonda.engine.cylinders); // Output: 4
    ```
    This relates to the idea that attributes like RAM or Processor could themselves be considered objects with their own properties.

4.  **Conditional Object Creation:** You can create and assign an object based on a condition.
    ```javascript
    let condition = true; // or false
    let objectX = condition ? {
        property1: "value1",
        property2: "value2"
    } : null; // Object is created only if condition is true
    ```

These methods demonstrate some of the ways objects are created and manipulated in JavaScript, highlighting its Object-Based nature.
