# Introduction to web

**Q1.Explains what is WWW, internet, client, server, client-server architecture, working of web and the common web terminologies such as URL, HTTP, MIME Summary of Web ?**
• WWW: The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the internet. It allows users to view and navigate web pages using browsers.
• Internet: A global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols. It enables data exchange and resource sharing among millions of devices worldwide.
• Client: A client is a device or software that requests services or resources from a server. Examples include web browsers, email clients, and mobile apps.
• Server: A server is a computer or software that provides services or resources to clients. It hosts websites, manages databases, and handles requests from clients.
• Client-Server Architecture: A computing model where clients request services and servers provide them. It enables efficient resource management and centralized control.
• Working of Web: The web operates on a client-server model. Clients send requests to servers using URLs. Servers process these requests and send back the requested resources.
• URL: Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the address used to access resources on the web. It specifies the protocol, domain, and path to the resource.
• HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used for transferring web pages and resources over the internet. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.
• MIME: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is a standard that extends the format of email to support text in character sets other than ASCII, as well as attachments like images and documents.thumbs_up_downmore_vertnorthrefreshkeyboard_arrow_downmicsend 

# Full-Stack

- Overview of Web Technologies

Web technologies encompass a broad range of tools and techniques used to create and manage websites and web applications. These technologies can be broadly categorized into front-end, back-end, and full-stack development. Each category plays a crucial role in the overall functionality and user experience of web applications.

# Front-End

Front-end development focuses on the client side of web applications, which is what users interact with directly in their web browsers. The main technologies used in front-end development include:

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

- **Purpose**: Provides the structure of web pages.
- **Significance**: HTML is the backbone of any web page. It defines elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other types of content. Without HTML, web pages would lack structure and organization.
- **Example**:
    
    ```html
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1><p>This is a paragraph of text on my website.</p>
    ```
    

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- **Purpose**: Adds styling to web pages.
- **Significance**: CSS is used to control the presentation of HTML elements, including layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual aesthetics. It allows developers to create visually appealing and responsive designs.
- **Example**:
    
    ```css
    body {    background-color: lightblue;}h1 {    color: navy;    text-align: center;}
    ```
    

### JavaScript

- **Purpose**: Adds interactivity and dynamic content to web pages.
- **Significance**: JavaScript enables the creation of interactive elements such as forms, animations, and real-time updates. It enhances user experience by allowing web pages to respond to user actions without needing to reload.
- **Example**:
    
    ```jsx
    document.getElementById("myButton").onclick = function() {    alert("Button clicked!");};
    ```
    

# Back-End

Back-end development focuses on the server side of web applications, which involves managing data and handling requests from the front end. The main components of back-end development include:

### Server

- **Purpose**: Handles client requests and serves content.
- **Significance**: Servers like Apache and Nginx manage incoming requests from users' browsers, process them, and return the appropriate responses. They are essential for delivering web content and services.
- **Example**: Apache and Nginx are popular web servers used to host websites.

### Databases

- **Purpose**: Stores and manages data.
- **Significance**: Databases like MySQL and MongoDB are used to store user information, content, and other data required by web applications. They allow for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Example**:
    - **MySQL**: A relational database management system.
    - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability.

### Server-Side Languages

- **Purpose**: Processes data and executes server-side logic.
- **Significance**: Languages like Node.js, Python, and PHP are used to write the server-side code that interacts with databases, processes user input, and performs other backend operations. They are crucial for creating dynamic and functional web applications.
- **Example**:
    - **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
    - **Python**: A versatile language known for its readability and efficiency.
    - **PHP**: A widely-used open-source scripting language.

# Full-Stack

Full-stack development involves working with both front-end and back-end technologies to create complete web applications. Full-stack developers have the skills to handle all aspects of web development, from designing user interfaces to managing servers and databases.

### Significance

- **Comprehensive Skill Set**: Full-stack developers can build entire web applications from scratch, making them highly versatile and valuable in the tech industry.
- **Efficiency**: Having a single developer or team handle both front-end and back-end development can streamline the development process and improve communication.
- **Example**: A full-stack developer might use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, while using Node.js and MongoDB for the back end.

In summary, understanding the different components of web technologies and how they interact is essential for anyone looking to develop modern web applications. Each technology plays a specific role in creating a seamless and functional user experience.

Q3.Core Web Technologies and Full Stack DevelopmentHTML:

ANS: The standard markup language for creating web pages. It structures the content on the web.CSS: A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. Scripting Languages: JavaScript is the most popular, enabling interactive web pages. Popular Web Frameworks/Libraries: React, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end development. Back-end Frameworks: Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails. Full Stack Technologies: MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
