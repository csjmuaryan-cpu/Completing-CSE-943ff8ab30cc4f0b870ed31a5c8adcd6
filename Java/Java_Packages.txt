Java Packages and Streams: Unit 2 Summary
This note summarizes the concepts of Packages and Streams as discussed, along with lab work instructions.

1. Understanding Packages: An Analogy
Think about organizing a bag for a trip:

Disorganized: Putting everything (laptop, books, food, pens) randomly in one large compartment makes it hard to find things quickly. Searching for a pen means digging through everything.
Organized: Using different compartments or smaller boxes/tiffin carriers for specific items (laptop in back, books in front, food in a tiffin, water separately, pens/erasers in a small box). This makes accessing specific items easy and efficient.
This organized approach, grouping similar items together, is similar to how Packages work in programming.

2. What is a Package?
A Package is a collection of similar types of items, specifically in Java, it's a way to group related classes, interfaces, and other packages (sub-packages).
It's like creating folders on your computer to organize files. You put related program files (classes) into specific folders (packages).
This creates a hierarchical structure, like MainFolder -> SubFolder -> SpecificTopicFolder -> ProgramFiles. For example, BTech -> SecondYear -> JavaTraining -> Exceptions -> ExceptionProgram.java.
3. Why Use Packages? (Advantages)
Creating and using packages offers several benefits:

Organization and Categorization: Grouping similar classes makes your code base organized and easy to navigate, especially in large projects.
Maintainability: Organized code is easier to maintain, debug, and update.
Reusability: Classes within a package can be easily reused in other parts of your project or different projects simply by importing the package.
Name Collision Resolution: Packages help avoid conflicts when different classes have the same name.
Example: There's a Date class in java.util and another in java.sql. If you need both, you import them using their full package names (java.util.Date and java.sql.Date) or refer to them with their full name when used, preventing confusion.
Access Protection: Packages provide access control mechanisms (like default and protected modifiers) that restrict access to classes, members, or interfaces to other components within the same package, similar to locking a folder on your computer.
4. Built-in Java Packages
Java provides many pre-built packages (often called the Java API or Library) that contain useful classes. Examples include:

java.lang (fundamental classes, automatically imported)
java.util (utility classes like Scanner, Date, ArrayList)
java.io (Input/Output operations)
GUI packages (java.awt, javax.swing)
You can also create your own user-defined packages.

5. Declaring and Importing Packages
Declaring a Package:

The package statement must be the first statement in a Java file (after comments).
It specifies the package the classes in that file belong to.
Syntax: package package_name;
Example: If your class Sum.java is in a folder named my_package, the first line of the file would be: package my_package;
Importing a Package/Class:

To use classes from another package (built-in or user-defined), you use the import statement.
This statement comes after the package declaration (if any) and before any class definitions.
Syntax (to import a specific class): import package_name.ClassName;
Syntax (to import all classes in a package): import package_name.*;
Example: To use the Sum class from my_package in another file: import my_package.Sum; or import my_package.*;
6. Streams (Input/Output)
Streams represent the flow of data.

They are categorized based on the direction of data flow relative to the program:

Input Stream: Data flows from a source (like a keyboard, file, scanner) into the program.
Output Stream: Data flows from the program to a destination (like the console, a file).
Note: Be sure to understand the difference between input and output streams.

7. Lab Work and Next Steps
Make sure all programs discussed are created and saved.
Copies will be checked soon. Ensure your work is complete.
We have finished Unit 2. Notes for Unit 2 will be shared.
We will move on to Advanced Java Features and Units 3 & 4, which will involve hands-on programming in the lab.
This concludes the summary of Unit 2 topics.
