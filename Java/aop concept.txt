AOP Concepts
Weaving
It is a process of linking aspects (advice) with other application types or objects to create an advised object.
Advice can be applied.
It can be done at:
Compile Time
Load Time
Run Time
Spring AOP performs weaving at Run Time.
Pointcut
Since it's not feasible to apply advice at every point of the code, the selected joint points where advice is finally applied are known as the Pointcut.
POJO (Plain Old Java Object)
A POJO is an object which encapsulates business logic.
Characteristics:
Should not extend pre-specified classes.
Should not implement pre-specified interfaces.
Should not contain pre-specified annotations.
No restriction on constructor presence or arguments (may or may not have a no-argument constructor).
Fields can have any visibility (public, private, protected, default).
Used when you don't want to restrict access to members and want to give the user complete access to the entity.
Bean
A Bean is a special type of POJO intended to be a reusable component.
Characteristics (making it different from a general POJO):
Fields typically have only private visibility.
Must have a no-argument constructor (either implicitly provided by Java or explicitly defined).
Provides complete control; fields are accessed only by getter and setter methods.
Relationship: Every Bean is a POJO, but not every POJO is a Bean.
Used when you want to provide the user with your entity but restrict access to only certain parts or control access through getter/setter functionality.
MVC Architecture (Model-View-Controller)
A distributed system architecture pattern.
Components:
Model: Represents the data and business logic (often implemented using Beans/POJOs).
View: Handles the presentation of the data to the user.
Controller: Handles user input, interacts with the Model, and selects the appropriate View.
Spring Framework is built entirely on the MVC pattern (Spring MVC).
Singleton
A design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to only one object.
Spring Bean Scope - Singleton:
The container creates exactly one instance of the object defined by that bean.
This single instance is stored in a cache.
All subsequent requests for that bean instance are referenced to the same single instance.
Any modification made to the object will be reflected in all parts of the application accessing that bean instance.
DAO Design Pattern (Data Access Object)
It is a design pattern that creates an abstraction layer between the business logic and the data storage (like a database).

Purpose:

Prevents direct access to the data storage layer from the business logic.
Provides flexibility; the underlying data storage mechanism can be changed without affecting the business logic.
Enhances modularity and separation of concerns.
Increases security by controlling how data is accessed.
Business Logic vs. Programming Logic:

Programming Logic: The technical tasks required to make things work (e.g., performing a transaction, connecting to a database). This is often standard across applications.
Business Logic: Company-specific rules and strategies for how operations are conducted or how value is created/delivered (e.g., offering cashback, optimizing transaction speed, specific pricing rules). This is often highly sensitive and needs to be kept separate and secured.
The DAO pattern helps separate Business Logic, Programming Logic, and Data Storage, promoting a more structured and maintainable application.
