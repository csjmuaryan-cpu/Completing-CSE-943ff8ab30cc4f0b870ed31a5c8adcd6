how to write a multifile program?

Writing a multifile program involves splitting your code into multiple files for better organization, readability, and maintainability. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

Plan Your Project Structure: Before writing any code, plan out the structure of your project. Decide which functionality will go into which file and how they will interact.

Create Separate Files for Each Module: Identify the different modules or components of your program and create separate files for each of them. For example, you might have one file for the main program logic, another for utility functions, and additional files for specific features or classes.

Define Module Interfaces: For each module, define the interface - that is, the functions, classes, and variables that other parts of the program will use. This helps to establish clear boundaries between modules and makes it easier to understand how they interact.

Import Modules: In the main file or any other file where you need to use functionality from other modules, import them using the import statement in Python or the equivalent in other programming languages.

Organize Your Code: Write the code for each module in its respective file, following the interfaces you defined earlier. Make sure to keep related code together and use meaningful names for files, functions, and variables to make your codebase easier to navigate.

Handle Dependencies: If one module depends on another, make sure to handle the dependencies properly. For example, you might need to import a module before you can use its functions or classes.

Testing: Test each module independently to ensure that it works as expected. This will help you catch any errors early on and make debugging easier.

Package Your Program (Optional): If your program is large or intended for distribution, you may want to package it into a library or executable. This typically involves creating a setup script and using a tool like setuptools or PyInstaller to create the package.

Documentation: Document your code, including each module's purpose, the functions or classes it provides, and any important usage details. This will make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand and use your code.
