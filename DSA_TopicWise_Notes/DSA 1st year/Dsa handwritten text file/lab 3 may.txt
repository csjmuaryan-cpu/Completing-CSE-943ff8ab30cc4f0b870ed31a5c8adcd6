You are given a number of sticks of varying lengths. You will iteratively cut the sticks into smaller sticks, discarding the shortest pieces until there are none left. At each iteration you will determine the length of the shortest stick remaining, cut that length from each of the longer sticks and then discard all the pieces of that shortest length. When all the remaining sticks are the same length, they cannot be shortened so discard them.
Given the lengths of n sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each iteration until there are none left.You are given a number of sticks of varying lengths.

arr=[1,2,3]
the sortest stick lwnth is 1,so length is 1, so cut that length from the longer two and dioscard the pieces of length 1.now the length are aRR=[1,2].Again,the sortest is stick of length 1, so cut that amount from the longer stick and discard those pieces.there is only one stick left,arr=[1],so discard that stick.the number of stick at each iteration are answer=[3,2,1].

Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id of the most frequently sighted type. If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.
