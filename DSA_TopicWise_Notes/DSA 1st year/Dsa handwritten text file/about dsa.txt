dsa is representation of the logical relationship b/w individual element of the data.
mainly specifies:
1:organising of data
2:accessing of data
3:degree of associativity
4:processing alternatives for imformations.

ALGORITHM +DATA STRUCTURE = PROGRAMS
classification in two ways:
1:Primitive Data Structure
a:integer
b:float
c:character
d:pointer

2:Non-Primitive Data Structure
a:arrays
b:lists:
	TYPES of linked list
		1.singly linked list
		2.doubly linked list
		3.circular linked list
	a:linear list
		a:stacks
		b:queues
	b:Non-Linear list
		a:graphs
		b:trees

c:file

most commonly used operations:
1. Create
2. Destroy or Delete
3. Selection
4. Updation

commonly operation used in arrays are:
1.creating of an array.
2.traversing an array acessing an array elements.
3.insertion of new elment.
4.deletion of required element.
5.Modification of an element.
6.Merging of an arrays.

Commonly operation used in linked list are:
	1.creating of an linked list.
	2.traversing an linked list {acessing an linked list elements}.	
	3.insertion of new elment.
	4.deletion of required element.
	5.Modification of an element.
	6.Merging of an linked list.

ways of designing  an algorithm
1.increment apporach
2.divide and conqure

the space complexity  of a program is the amount of memory is needed to run OR to complete categories in to type:
1.fixed part that include spaces for the code,spaces for the code, space for simple variable and fixed size component variables, spaces for control etc.
2.variable part that consist of the spaces needed by  component whose size is dependent on the particular problem instance being solved and the stack spaces used by the recurcive problem.
