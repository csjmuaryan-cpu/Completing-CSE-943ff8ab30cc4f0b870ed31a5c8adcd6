HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
A Simple HTML Document
Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
Example Explained
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph
What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Start tag	Element content	End tag
<h1>	My First Heading	</h1>
<p>	My first paragraph.	</p>
<br>	none	none
Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:

View in Browser

HTML Page Structure
Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
Note: The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

HTML Editors
A simple text editor is all you need to learn HTML.

Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit
Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.

However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).

We believe that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.

Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.

Step 1: Open Notepad (PC)
Windows 8 or later:

Open the Start Screen (the window symbol at the bottom left on your screen). Type Notepad.

Windows 7 or earlier:

Open Start > Programs > Accessories > Notepad

Step 1: Open TextEdit (Mac)
Open Finder > Applications > TextEdit

Also change some preferences to get the application to save files correctly. In Preferences > Format > choose "Plain Text"

Then under "Open and Save", check the box that says "Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text".

Then open a new document to place the code.

Step 2: Write Some HTML
Write or copy the following HTML code into Notepad:
Step 3: Save the HTML Page
Save the file on your computer. Select File > Save as in the Notepad menu.

Name the file "index.htm" and set the encoding to UTF-8 (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files).
Step 4: View the HTML Page in Your Browser
Open the saved HTML file in your favorite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").
In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.

Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.

HTML Documents
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:

<!DOCTYPE html>
HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 

Example
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
HTML Paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:

Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
HTML Links
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter.

HTML Images
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:

Example
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
How to View HTML Source
Have you ever seen a Web page and wondered "Hey! How did they do that?"

View HTML Source Code:
Click CTRL + U in an HTML page, or right-click on the page and select "View Page Source". This will open a new tab containing the HTML source code of the page.

Inspect an HTML Element:
Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose "Inspect" to see what elements are made up of (you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.
HTML Elements
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

HTML Elements
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Examples of some HTML elements:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Start tag	Element content	End tag
<h1>	My First Heading	</h1>
<p>	My first paragraph.	</p>
<br>	none	none
Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
Example Explained
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.

It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.

Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element:

<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
The <body> element defines the document's body.

It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.

Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
The <h1> element defines a heading.

It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
The <p> element defines a paragraph.

It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>:

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

Never Skip the End Tag
Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:

Example
<html>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph
<p>This is a paragraph

</body>
</html>
However, never rely on this! Unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag!

Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

Example
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

At W3Schools we always use lowercase tag names.

HTML Tag Reference
W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about these tags and their attributes.

Tag	Description
<html>	Defines the root of an HTML document
<body>	Defines the document's body
<h1> to <h6>	Defines HTML headings
For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference.
HTML Attributes
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>
You will learn more about links in our HTML Links chapter.

The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg">
There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

The width and height Attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
Example
See what happens if we try to display an image that does not exist:

<img src="img_typo.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
You will learn more about images in our HTML Images chapter.

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Example
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
You will learn more about styles in our HTML Styles chapter.

The lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

The following example specifies English as the language:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
You can see all the language codes in our HTML Language Code Reference.

The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Example
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes
The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.

However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML.

At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names.

We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values
The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.

However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.

Good:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
Bad:
<a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/>Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:

Example
<p title=About W3Schools>
 At W3Schools we always use quotes around attribute values.

Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
Or vice versa:

<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">

Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

Bigger Headings
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:

Example
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

The HTML Style Attribute
Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.

The HTML style attribute has the following syntax:

<tagname style="property:value;">
The property is a CSS property. The value is a CSS value.

You will learn more about CSS later in this tutorial.

Background Color
The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.

Example
Set the background color for a page to powderblue:

<body style="background-color:powderblue;">

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
Example
Set background color for two different elements:

<body>

<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="background-color:tomato;">This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>

Text Color
The CSS color property defines the text color for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="color:blue;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
Fonts
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p>
Text Size
The CSS font-size property defines the text size for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p>
Chapter Summary
Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
Use background-color for background color
Use color for text colors
Use font-family for text fonts
Use font-size for text sizes
Use text-align for text alignment
HTML Text Formatting
HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.

Example
This text is bold

This text is italic

This is subscript and superscript

HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text
HTML <b> and <strong> Elements
The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

Example
<b>This text is bold</b>
The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.

Example
<strong>This text is important!</strong>
ADVERTISEMENT

HTML <i> and <em> Elements
The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.

Example
<i>This text is italic</i>
The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

Example
<em>This text is emphasized</em>
HTML <small> Element
The HTML <small> element defines smaller text:

Example
<small>This is some smaller text.</small>
HTML <mark> Element
The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:

Example
<p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>
HTML <del> Element
The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text:

Example
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p>
HTML <ins> Element
The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text:

Example
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>
HTML <sub> Element
The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:

Example
<p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>
HTML <sup> Element
The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1]:

Example
<p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>
HTML Quotation and Citation Elements
In this chapter we will go through the <blockquote>,<q>, <abbr>, <address>, <cite>, and <bdo> HTML elements.

Example
Here is a quote from WWF's website:

For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.
HTML <blockquote> for Quotations
The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.

Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.

Example
<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.
</blockquote>
HTML <q> for Short Quotations
The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.

Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

Example
<p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>
ADVERTISEMENT

HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations
The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".

Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.

Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. 

Example
<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>
HTML <address> for Contact Information
The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.

The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.

The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.

Example
<address>
Written by John Doe.<br>
Visit us at:<br>
Example.com<br>
Box 564, Disneyland<br>
USA
</address>
HTML <cite> for Work Title
The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).

Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.

The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.

Example
<p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>
HTML <bdo> for Bi-Directional Override
BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.

The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:

Example
<bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo>

For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference.HTML Comments
HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

HTML Comment Tag
You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:

<!-- Write your comments here -->
Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.

Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

Add Comments
With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:

Example
<!-- This is a comment -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Remember to add more information here -->
Hide Content
Comments can be used to hide content.

This can be helpful if you hide content temporarily:

Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->

<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
You can also hide more than one line. Everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hidden from the display.

Example
Hide a section of HTML code:

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!--
<p>Look at this cool image:</p>
<img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
-->
<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.

ADVERTISEMENT
Hide Inline Content
Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.

Example
Hide a part of a paragraph:

<p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>

<h1 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;">Hello World</h1>
Color Values
In HTML, colors can also be specified using RGB values, HEX values, HSL values, RGBA values, and HSLA values.

The following three <div> elements have their background color set with RGB, HEX, and HSL values:

rgb(255, 99, 71)
#ff6347
hsl(9, 100%, 64%)
The following two <div> elements have their background color set with RGBA and HSLA values, which add an Alpha channel to the color (here we have 50% transparency):

rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5)
Example
<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">...</h1>

<h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">...</h1>
HTML Styles - CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

CSS = Styles and Colors
Manipulate Text
Colors,  Boxes

What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!

Using CSS
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.

Inline CSS
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.

The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, and the text color of the <p> element to red:

Example
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>

<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>
ADVERTISEMENT

Internal CSS
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.

The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color: 

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
External CSS
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.

Here is what the "styles.css" file looks like:

"styles.css":
body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
Tip: With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!

CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes
Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will learn more about them later.

The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.

The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.

The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.

Example
Use of CSS color, font-family and font-size properties:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 300%;
}
p {
  color: red;
  font-family: courier;
  font-size: 160%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
CSS Border
The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element.

Tip: You can define a border for nearly all HTML elements.

Example
Use of CSS border property: 

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
}
CSS Padding
The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.

Example
Use of CSS border and padding properties:

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  padding: 30px;
}
CSS Margin
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.

Example
Use of CSS border and margin properties:

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  margin: 50px;
}
Link to External CSS
External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.

Example
This example uses a full URL to link to a style sheet:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/styles.css">

Example
This example links to a style sheet located in the html folder on the current web site: 

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/html/styles.css">

Example
This example links to a style sheet located in the same folder as the current page:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

You can read more about file paths in the chapter HTML File Paths.

Chapter Summary
Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling
Use the HTML <style> element to define internal CSS
Use the HTML <link> element to refer to an external CSS file
Use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements
Use the CSS color property for text colors
Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
Use the CSS border property for borders
Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border
Tip: You can learn much more about CSS in our CSS Tutorial.
HTML Links
Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

HTML Links - Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

<a href="url">link text</a>
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

Example
This example shows how to create a link to W3Schools.com:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>
By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
Tip: Links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look!

HTML Links - The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
Example
Use target="_blank" to open the linked document in a new browser window or tab:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>
Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):

Example
<h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

<h2>Relative URLs</h2>
<p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></p>
<p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>
ADVERTISEMENT

HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="default.asp">
<img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>
Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

Example
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>
Button as a Link
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:

Example
<button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>
Tip: Learn more about JavaScript in our JavaScript Tutorial.

Link Titles
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a>
More on Absolute URLs and Relative URLs
Example
Use a full URL to link to a web page: 

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

Example
Link to a page located in the html folder on the current web site: 

<a href="/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

Example
Link to a page located in the same folder as the current page: 

<a href="default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

You can read more about file paths in the chapter HTML File Paths.

Chapter Summary
Use the <a> element to define a link
Use the href attribute to define the link address
Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program

HTML Links - Different Colors
An HTML link is displayed in a different color depending on whether it has been visited, is unvisited, or is active.

HTML Link Colors
By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
You can change the link state colors, by using CSS:

Example
Here, an unvisited link will be green with no underline. A visited link will be pink with no underline. An active link will be yellow and underlined. In addition, when mousing over a link (a:hover) it will become red and underlined:

<style>
a:link {
  color: green;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:visited {
  color: pink;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  color: red;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:active {
  color: yellow;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
</style>

Link Buttons
A link can also be styled as a button, by using CSS:

This is a link
Example
<style>
a:link, a:visited {
  background-color: #f44336;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 25px;
  text-align: center;

HTML Links - Create Bookmarks
HTML links can be used to create bookmarks, so that readers can jump to specific parts of a web page.

Create a Bookmark in HTML
Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.

To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it.

When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark.

Example
First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark:

<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:

Example
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
You can also add a link to a bookmark on another page:

<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

Chapter Summary
Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark

HTML Link Tags
Tag	Description
<a>	Defines a hyperlink
For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference.
HTML Images
Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

Example
<img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">
Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket">
Example
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
HTML Images Syntax
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
Syntax
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">
The src Attribute
The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

Note: When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.

Example
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
ADVERTISEMENT

The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:

Example
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute:

Example
<img src="wrongname.gif" alt="Flowers in Chania">
Tip: A screen reader is a software program that reads the HTML code, and allows the user to "listen" to the content. Screen readers are useful for people who are visually impaired or learning disabled.

Image Size - Width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
Alternatively, you can use the width and height attributes:

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
The width and height attributes always define the width and height of the image in pixels.

Note: Always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the web page might flicker while the image loads.

Width and Height, or Style?
The width, height, and style attributes are all valid in HTML.

However, we suggest using the style attribute. It prevents styles sheets from changing the size of images:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
img {
  width: 100%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="128" height="128">

<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">

</body>
</html>
Images in Another Folder
If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute:

Example
<img src="/images/html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">
Images on Another Server/Website
Some web sites point to an image on another server.

To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:

Example
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com">
Notes on external images: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; they can suddenly be removed or changed.

Animated Images
HTML allows animated GIFs:

Example
<img src="programming.gif" alt="Computer Man" style="width:48px;height:48px;">
Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>
Image Floating
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:

Example
<p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">
The image will float to the right of the text.</p>

<p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:left;width:42px;height:42px;">
The image will float to the left of the text.</p>
Tip: To learn more about CSS Float, read our CSS Float Tutorial.

Common Image Formats
Here are the most common image file types, which are supported in all browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera):

Abbreviation	File Format	File Extension
APNG	Animated Portable Network Graphics	.apng
GIF	Graphics Interchange Format	.gif
ICO	Microsoft Icon	.ico, .cur
JPEG	Joint Photographic Expert Group image	.jpg, .jpeg, .jfif, .pjpeg, .pjp
PNG	Portable Network Graphics	.png
SVG	Scalable Vector Graphics	.svg
Chapter Summary
Use the HTML <img> element to define an image
Use the HTML src attribute to define the URL of the image
Use the HTML alt attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed
Use the HTML width and height attributes or the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the left or to the right
Note: Loading large images takes time, and can slow down your web page. Use images carefully.
