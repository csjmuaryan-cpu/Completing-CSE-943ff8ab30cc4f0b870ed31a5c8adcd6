# Programming Basis

1. **Variable-:**Which hold data,variable  is the way to do that.

Ex:

$$
x²+2y-2=1; x,y belong to  data.
$$

1. **Data type**: In a programming language is a set of data with predefined values. Example of their type are : integer, floating point, unit number, string,character etc.
    1. System- define data (also called primitive data types): these are defined by system.**The number of bits alligator for each primitive data type depends on the programming languages the compiler in the operating system. For the same primitive data type, different languages may use different sizes. Depending on the size of the data types, the total available(domain) value will also change**. 
    2. User defined data types: if the system define data type or not enough, then most programming language allow the user to define their own datatype.

```cpp
struct newType{
int data1;
float data2;
....
char data;
};
```
