# SKIP THE PROGRAMMING :USE FRONT PAGE EXPRESS

FrontPage Express was a web design and editing tool that Microsoft released in the late 1990s as a lighter version of FrontPage. It offered a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface for creating and managing web pages without needing to write code manually. Here’s a guide on how you would use FrontPage Express for creating and managing HTML elements:

### Getting Started with FrontPage Express

1. **Opening FrontPage Express**:
    - Launch FrontPage Express from your applications menu or shortcut.
2. **Creating a New Web Page**:
    - Go to `File` > `New` > `Page` or `File` > `New` > `Web` to start a new web page or website.
3. **Editing the Page**:
    - The main interface allows you to design your page visually. You’ll see a blank workspace where you can add elements.

### Adding Common HTML Elements

1. **Adding Text**:
    - Simply click on the blank page and start typing to add text.
    - Use the formatting toolbar to change font size, style, and color.
2. **Inserting Headings**:
    - Select the text you want to turn into a heading.
    - Use the formatting options to choose heading levels (e.g., Heading 1, Heading 2).
3. **Creating Paragraphs**:
    - Type your text and press `Enter` to start a new paragraph.
4. **Adding Links**:
    - Highlight the text you want to use as a link.
    - Click the "Insert Hyperlink" button or right-click and select `Hyperlink`.
    - Enter the URL in the dialog box that appears.
5. **Inserting Images**:
    - Go to `Insert` > `Image` or use the image icon in the toolbar.
    - Select an image file from your computer and click `Insert`.
6. **Creating Lists**:
    - Click where you want the list to start.
    - Use the toolbar buttons for unordered (bulleted) or ordered (numbered) lists.
7. **Adding Tables**:
    - Go to `Insert` > `Table`.
    - Specify the number of rows and columns in the dialog box and click `OK`.
    - Enter your data into the table cells.
8. **Inserting Forms**:
    - Go to `Insert` > `Form`.
    - Add form elements such as text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons from the toolbar.

### Saving and Previewing Your Page

1. **Saving Your Work**:
    - Go to `File` > `Save` or `Save As`.
    - Choose a name for your file and select the location to save it.
2. **Previewing Your Page**:
    - Click `View` > `Preview in Browser` to see how your page will look in a web browser.

### Publishing Your Web Page

1. **Publishing**:
    - If you want to publish your web page online, you need to upload it to a web server.
    - FrontPage Express may offer a publishing feature, or you might need to use an FTP client to upload the files.

### Tips for Using FrontPage Express

- **Design Consistency**: Maintain consistent design elements across pages (fonts, colors, layout) for a cohesive look.
- **Testing**: Always preview your page in multiple browsers to ensure compatibility.
- **Backup**: Regularly save backups of your work to prevent data loss.

FrontPage Express was designed to make web design accessible without coding knowledge, and while it’s outdated compared to modern tools, it was a stepping stone in making web development more user-friendly. If you're looking for a more contemporary tool, consider using software like Microsoft’s newer offerings or other WYSIWYG editors such as Adobe Dreamweaver or online platforms like WordPress and Wix.
